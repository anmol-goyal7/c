# C

A collection of C programs written while learning and practicing the language.

This repository is mainly used to:
- try out concepts in C
- write small programs and exercises
- build simple CLI projects
- keep track of progress over time

## Contents

The code here covers topics like:
- arrays and strings
- pointers and memory
- functions and recursion
- structures
- basic games and utilities (CLI)

Each file is mostly self-contained and focuses on a specific idea.

## Running the code

Most programs can be compiled with `gcc`:

```bash
gcc file.c -o file
./file
